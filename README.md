# DMS  - Connecting Healthcare Service Providers and Patients Worldwide on ICP

## Introduction

DMS is an innovative e-Healthcare platform established on the Internet Computer (ICP). It aims to revolutionize healthcare service delivery by connecting healthcare service providers and patients globally through a unified platform. 

## Project Aim

Today's healthcare service providers deliver their services using their own corporate web services. 
This corporate approach restricts both the healthcare service providers and patients in their service exchange network.
DMS aims to bring healthcare service providers and visitors together on a single platform that is more functional, meeting all their needs beyond their current systems. 
This way, we are enhancing the service network of healthcare providers and visitors on a global scale.
